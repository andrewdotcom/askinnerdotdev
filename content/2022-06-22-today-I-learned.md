While pondering how mid-life appears to have somehow crept up behind me and given me a stellar wedgie, I realised that I have learned quite a few interesting things over the years. I thought that I would share some of these pearls of wisdom on my blog so that the next generation of people like me can roll their eyes and ignore them as I initially did.

I'm going to collect them under the tag "IHL" - I have learned. I'm not sure where this will go but you never know. Someone may find them them useful.

I thought a little about doing something similar to [Simon Wilison's TIL](https://simonwillison.net/2020/Apr/20/self-rewriting-readme/) - Today I learneds (which IHL is clearly inspired by) but instead I am going to write a little longer at times so decided to stick with the blog for now.
