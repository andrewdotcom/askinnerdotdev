I made another small LLM tool recently. Itâ€™s a basic link manager. It lets me save links to things I want to remember on the web and then summarises the contents of the linked page before making it available as an RSS feed. All the links are held in a SQLite database. The link contents are also chunked and have embeddings created. These are also stored in the database. That way I can search across topics too.

Why did I make this? It was just another experiment really to get my head into embeddings and other things but I do have a need to get on top of the mountain of links that I optimistically save everyday to read. Summarising them seems to be a good way to filter them so I can tell which I really need to read in detail.
