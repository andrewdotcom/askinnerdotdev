Last night I made a Rube Goldberg machine with my son for his school assignment. We had a lot of fun making it but I was so surprised at how hard it was to get right.

A [Rube Goldberg](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg_machine) machine is a machine that tries to do something really simple but in an over engineered and complicated way. It’s named after an [American cartoonist and inventor](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rube_Goldberg) who drew these complicated machines.

Our machine had about 8 steps in it and involved pouring water, cups, dominos, balls, a train and even a fart machine on a zip wire. The end result was a just simply switching on light. You can see a picture of it all below.

At every stage something went wrong, usually in some random order. It was a very iterative process. On one run, the cup wouldn’t knock over the dominos. On the next run the cup knocked the dominos over but the fart machine wouldn’t release and slide down the zip wire, on another the train came off the track etc. etc. etc. We learnt very quickly that the [KISS rule](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) 100% applies when making Rube Goldberg machines. Now I think about it, the analogies to software development are many and painfully familiar. Iterative testing, regressions, many small but complex functional units loosely linked and all for a simple outcome but in the shadow of overly complex/ambitious design and first try architecture.

In the end we managed to get it done and to say we were proud of what we made is an understatement. Fingers crossed his teacher feels the same way and gives him some good marks.
