Well if you can call this a streak, it’s a streak. Second week of weeknotes incoming. 

*Last week:*

I’m still on the last few weeks of my Christmas break but with people returning to work a few phonecalls, meetings and emails are starting to creep in. 

Preparations for evokeAG in Feb are continuing and the program we are pulling together is starting to take shape. 

Work on a new AI driven project I’m developing is progressing. This week I completed the core structure. 

*Next week:*

I have a few reports to edit that have been sitting in my desk since before Christmas that I need to get done. 

Work will continue on the AI project. 

I also have a couple of APIs that I need to explore one for a farm management system I may be using for some work in the next couple of months and one for a new climate calculation platform. 

Finally I need to finish the [More Than Machines](http://www.morethanmachines.com) website. 

All this while spending as much time as I can with my parents before they head back to the U.K.
