Maybe I should have called this occasional week notes or month notes or something. 

I think my inability to publish weeknotes every week says a lot about my work ethic. It’s not that I don’t work hard, I do, but I get very easily distracted by shiny things and go DEEP down the rabbit holes. 

Over the last few weeks that has continued to be AI. There is so much incredibly interesting stuff going on at the moment. Tools, papers, blog posts, videos are all being published hourly with stuff that I MUST READ/CONSUME/UNDERSTAND/TRY NOW! 

I’ve been continuing to build out my LLM benchmark for Australian agriculture. It’s still not published. Hopefully this week coming but I have been getting some interesting results. Some of the foundation LLMs are pretty good at responding to common agronomic questions that I think would be very helpful to farmers without the need for any specific fine tuning or RAG. Of course I still don’t think these tools should be put front of house (prompt injection, hallucinations etc.) but as contributors to processes and pipelines that support the collation of knowledge etc I think they already show a lot of potential. Other things I’ve been messing about with include; using multi modal LLMs to monitor plant health, farm safety etc. I’ve also been doing some stuff with ingredients but that’s for a future post. 

This week coming I am going to be running the NSW Agtech meetup in Sydney. I’ve been quite laid back about it up until this point but as of today I’m starting to fret a little. It should be good fun though and I’m interested to see how things go when we pivot to talking about tech. I’m planning on having a chat about the LLM benchmarking stuff so I’m interested to see how that’s going to be received. 

Other things going on include a few governance type projects, I have a couple of climate related things on the go at the moment too. I have also made some good progress on the new (first) More Than Machines website. I’m still not happy with it but I HAVE TO LET GOOOOO! 

As always lots and lots of other things on the boil including a load of stuff that I can’t/wont talk about yet. 

Oh and for some masochistic reason, I also started to write my own static blog generator this week. I have no idea why or if I’ll finish it but it seemed like a good idea at the time. 

Until next week!
