I’m sitting on a limestone wall in the sunshine waiting to collect my son from school. The weather is glorious. I love this time of year. The beginning of March to the end of April really are the best few weeks to be outside. As it happens, I’m appreciating things a bit more this week. Somehow I ended up checking out one of these death countdown clocks online this week. Apparently I’m 70% done. That’s quite sobering and very depressing. 

*Last week.*
The week just past I:
* Went to the city to hear my friend Jen Medway speak at the National Innovation Centre about how tech companies can build better products for farmers. 
* Sowed the seeds for a NSW agricultural technology meetup for developers, data scientists etc. the people who make the things that startups like to talk about. 
* I made a dent in the proposal writing. It’s still not done though. 
* Read a lot of AI research papers 

*Next week*
* Lots of emails to send - I’ve been slack in getting ion touch with people. I need to address that.
* I want to get version 1 of the MTM core platform ready for testing.
* Additionally I am hoping to finish the first version of a benchmark for fine tuned LLMs for the Australian Grain Sector. This one has been fun.
* Finishing and kicking off a couple of projects
* Getting on top of some financial stuff with my accountant
* I also have a few family trips to finalise.
