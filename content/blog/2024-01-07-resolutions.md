I didn’t do too well with my resolutions last year, don’t get me wrong I did manage to achieve quite a bit but not in the areas I thought were most important. I’m going to keep the same resolutions but have made a note below on progress. This year is all about focus so hopefully I’ll be able to make a bit more of a dent. I’m putting them here to keep me somewhat accountable.
