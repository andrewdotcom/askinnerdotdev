This year marks 25 years since I started work. Specifically since I graduated and got a full time job creating software and getting paid for it. It’s my longest running endeavour. I’ve been at this longer than I was at school and university combined. 

25 years of experiences is too much to fit into a blog post, but while at times this has been the most unforgiving profession that has had a profound effect on both my physical and mental health, it has also taken me all over the world, allowed me to collaborate with some of the smartest, creative, kind and most brilliant people imaginable and has enabled me to give myself and my family a good life. 

I’ve also learned so much. For much of those 25 years I have been self employed. I have worked across many fascinating sectors including finance, marketing, publishing, design through to events, production engineering, manufacturing, utilities, defence, health and agriculture.

25 years puts me firmly into the experienced (read old) category in our industry. My hair may not be in a Hoxton fin anymore and is considerably more grey but I feel the same as I did in the early 2000’s and for better or worse in most ways still act like it. I continue learn everyday and I still make mistakes, but the list of those I don’t make twice is now pretty extensive. In fact, I feel like I’m just getting started...
