Alexa let me down big time this week. A couple of weeks ago during the Amazon Prime sale I bought my wife a birthday present. It was delievered and I put it away for her birthday which isn't for a while. All good, a nice present at a good price and she was going to get a lovely surprise.

That is until Amazon decided to send a notification through to every Echo device in the house[^1] stating very clearly what I had bought and asking me to provide a review. Of course Mrs S noticed the green ring on the nearest Echo and asked Alexa to play the notification. Surprise ruined. ðŸ¤¬

It worked out pretty well for Mrs S as she got her present early but this is a very good example of poorly thought out communications on Amazon's part. They have no idea who may be listening to these messages they send but they send them anyway. Imagine if I had bought something more private from them and they had blurted it out in the kitchen while we had friends over.

These kind of notifications are best sent via other more personal channels such as SMS or email. Needless to say, next time I won't be buying birthday presents for my family from Amazon.

[^1]: Yes we have far too many Echo devices around the house listening to what we're doing.
