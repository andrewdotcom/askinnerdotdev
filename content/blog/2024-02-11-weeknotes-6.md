The observant of you (I’m assuming that someone other than me does read this stuff). Will have noticed that last week’s week notes didn’t happen. It wasn’t that I forgot, I had drafted something but I left it so late to post that it didn’t seem worth it. Anyway, let’s not dwell on it, this week quite a bit happened so hopefully this might be the turning point for boring week notes. 

*Last week*
I’m settling into being a house husband/Business owner and totally rocking the role. Kids were distributed at various swimming carnivals, chess clubs and sporting activities without breaking a sweat. 

I caught up with a good friend and we plotted how food retail giants could be disrupted - I think this one may spawn a prototype or two this year. 

I also managed to spend a couple of days in the city meeting with clients and fellow AgTech folk. Lots of change and It sounds like the recession is starting to bite the sector. 

I did a bit more work on the new MTM AI product. 

*Next week*
Lots of proposals to write, hopefully winning some new projects. 

Meeting with a stranger for coffee.

Flying to Perth for the evokeAG conference.
