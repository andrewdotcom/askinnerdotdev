I’m enjoying creating weeknotes. If I’m honest I didn’t think I would. That said, it’s week 3 and I’m already a few days late. I’m still not back to work yet fully. This past 5 weeks has been the longest continuous holiday I’ve ever taken. It’s been glorious, but I’m ready to get back to work now. 

*This week:*

I went hard this week on holiday stuff and didn’t do too much in the office. 

I briefed a couple of speakers about an online session I’m running next week. Lots of great ideas coming from that one to think about next week. It turns out a few of the startups we’ve been mentoring at the moment have learnt a lot over the last 6 months which is great to hear. 

I’m starting to worry about all the stuff that’s been sitting on my desk for the last 6 weeks. 

*Next week:*

Planning, I haven’t really planned anything yet for 2024. This is the first year I’ll be going back to a quiet office. On one hand this is a welcome change but I need to build some work now. This needs a plan. 

Lots of administrative stuff. I have a couple of reports to edit. I also need to move bank accounts as my current bank has decided it is no longer offering accounts to businesses. I need that like a whole in the head. 

I want to get some meetings locked in, lots of coffees in my near future. 

Finally, I’m dropping family at the airport.
