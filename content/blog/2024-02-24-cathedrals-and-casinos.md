I’ve been reading Chris Dixon’s [Read, Write, Own](https://readwriteown.com) book. You can read the many reviews of the book across the web so I won’t do that again here but on the whole I agree with them, he doesn’t provide any compelling examples of where blockchains really shine and he has a somewhat weird view on RSS. However, I did finish the book thinking that there is still something there - it’s just not a network that’s fully formed yet. 

In the book he talks a fair bit about Cathedrals and Casinos. He argues that the true blockchain craftspeople are building the cathedrals. What he means by this is that there are visionary craftspeople building the technology that care about it’s quality and application, that blockchain technology is improving and that many of the flaws hindering wide scale adoption are being addressed so that very soon it will be a viable technology to replace many existing applications. They are the Leonardo da Vincis, the visionaries that are creating the new churches in the next epoch in computing. Meanwhile there are those who built the casinos looking for a fast buck (think chimp nfts), ruining the reputation of the industry. These are the people who have been exposed as scammers, grifters and criminals. These are the people who sadly, may have perhaps irrevocably ruined the blockchain dream along the way. 

I like this metaphor of Cathedrals and Casinos. I think it applies in many areas of business. Anyone who knows me, knows I like a snappy [message house](https://messagehouse.org/) so I’ve taken this and have been testing it over the last few days in conversations I have been having about AI. We’re seeing a lot of the same actors move from blockchain to AI at this stage of the [hype cycle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gartner_hype_cycle) and I am fearful that we may see the trust in the technology lost to similar Casinos. 

Anyway, thanks to the book and in the absence of any interesting future networks or blockchain applications - blockchain has delivered me a nice snappy metaphor to wear out in company.
