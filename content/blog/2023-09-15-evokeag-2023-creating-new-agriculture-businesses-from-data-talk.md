A talk that I gave with my friend Andrew Cooke at the EvokeAG conference earlier this year [has been published as an audio podcast](https://www.buzzsprout.com/1085582/12740441-data-as-a-second-language). Andrew gives a great overview of the farm data scene. I talk about how farmers can bring digital products and services together to create new business opportunities and walk everyone through a simple example. It’s kind of no code, meets APIs meets farmer data kind of talk. I don’t accept many invites to do conference talks but this was great fun. It was also a popular session on the day (they had to close the doors) and I’ve had some lovely feedback on the content since.
