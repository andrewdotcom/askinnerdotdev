Weeknotes fell off the rails a little over the last few weeks. I’ve learnt that when things get busy, it’s easy to deprioritise blogging. I still have a bit of work to do to get into a habit of writing on a Friday. As a result there’s a few things to write up this week. 

I released a couple of small tools this week that help working with quantised LLMs through [Ollama](https://ollama.com). 

[llm.py](https://github.com/andrewdotcom/llm_tool) is a command line tool for providing content to different LLMs for inference. You can provide context through stdin, use prompt templates and a few other things. I made it to help with some of the data processing I am doing in my work for [More Than Machines](http://www.morethanmachines.com). 

Similarly I made a small tool [llm_sql](https://github.com/andrewdotcom/llm_sql) for generating sql queries for [duckdb](https://duckdb.org). For a given duckdb or [SQLite](https://sqlite.org) database the tool will pull the schema create the prompt template and apply the prompt before sending it to the [duckdb-sql](https://ollama.com/library/duckdb-nsql) LLM to infer the query. This is very much a work in progress and I have limited success with the model so far. Particularly for more complex queries. I’m going to experiment a bit more with the content of the prompt and see what improvements I can get over the coming weeks. 

I’m still trying to put some effort into planning the next phase of [More Than Machines](http://www.morethanmachines.com) and communicating the vision/strategy and products on LinkedIn. I figure doing this in the open will have two effects. First it will hold me accountable to actually doing something. Secondly it will put a stake in the ground for [More Than Machines](http://www.morethanmachines.com) in the area of AI. Still lots of work to do here though. 

The rest of this week has been spent getting back on top of work and following up with people after the [evokeAg conference](https://www.evokeag.com). There are lots of exciting conversations and opportunities for new projects. All very good. The downside is that I am up to my neck in proposals and haven’t really progressed through them this week. I need to find my proposal writing mojo next week. My present self is also a bit annoyed with my past self about some milestone dates for  a couple of final reports. 

Other things of note. 
* It’s been a hot week here. 40° as it turns out is pretty stifling when you are trying to work. 
* I’ve spent a fair chunk of time working from my local library this week because of their free aircon. They should really lean in more to the co-working shifts that are happening. Seems like an opportunity. 
* The AFL season starts next week. I’ve been trying to sign up for Kayo as they own the streaming rights for most games. It’s been an awful user experience and their app is pretty ordinary. We haven’t had a tv arial since we moved into our house 6+ years ago. 
* I submitted a security flaw to an organisation this week. I haven’t heard back from them. I can’t tell if they’re grateful or just ignoring me and the flaw.
