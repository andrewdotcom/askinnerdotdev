## Editor + Terminal

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is my current editor although I also spend a lot of time in DataGrip.
* I use the [GitHub Dark theme](https://github.com/primer/github-vscode-theme-dark-classic) and the default Visual Studio font.
* Safari is my main browser
* I am using [Warp](https://app.warp.dev/referral/24YX3G) as my terminal but often revert back to iTerm due to muscle memory.
* You can see my dot files over in my dot files repo.

## Desktop Apps

* DataGrip is the place I go for working with Databases of all types. I'm not in love with it and I probably use about 10% of what it's capable of. It has a habit of opening new windows as 1px high lines on my Mac.
* I use [Text Expander](https://smilesoftware.com/textexpander) for often used responses and for most of my code snippets
* I use [Things](https://culturedcode.com/things/) for managing my tasks - I should get better at using it though as I really only dump everything into the Today view and get stresses that i don't empty it each day.
* I use the Apple Notes app for my day to day note taking although I have also been experimenting with [Notion](https://www.notion.so).
* I have started to use [Cron](https://cron.com) to manage my work calendar
* I'm still a user of RSS and use [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com) almost daily.
* I do all my image editing using [GIMP](https://www.gimp.org) - GIMP is horrible to use and I constantly battle with it but it's pretty powerful and free. I keep meaning to do more and want to take a look at Figma for designing stuff at some point.

## Back up strategy

 * I use Time Machine to keep a local hot back up of my files that I export to a portable Lacie USB drive.
 * I back up everything to the cloud - nothing fancy, I am a fairly heavy user of iCloud.

# Desk Setup

* My Desk is an old door atop of some early 19th centuray ministery drawers. The drawers are pretty neat and have some cool features that Preists used for writing their ministeries. Lots of pull out flaps and stuff too. I really need to upgrade my desk setup at some point.
* My chain is a wooden/metal thing that i found in the hard waste on the side of the road. I sanded it down and tidied it up and it's now quite a nice piece. I have no idea what style it is or who made it but I love it. I sit on two old cushions I stole from the kids playroom.
* I currently use an Apple Studio M1 Max with 64GB RAM and a 1TB drive as my main work machine.
* The keyboard is an Apple keyboard with a number pad.
* My mouse is a standard Apple wireless mouse - the one with the charging port in the stupid place on the bottom. As a result, I almost never charge it.
* I have an Anker 6 port USB charger for charging all the things.

## Other Gear

* I run many Raspberry PIs for many different things including [Pi-hole](https://pi-hole.net) for keeping the adverts at bay.
* I have an Apple Watch Series 8, which I love and motivates me to get up and move. It doesn't really help e do much else other than tell the time but I still love it.
* I listen to Bose QC35 headphones all day at my desk and AirPods 3rd Generation when on the go. I have lost more than one pair so won't stump up for the AirPod Pros.
* I also keep an AirPod Mini on my desk for listening to the radio, music and asking Siri for things even though she never understands what I want.
