I’m used to starting these about/biography pages with work stuff but as I am getting older and my memory for remembering work stuff is getting worse, I thought that I would start by telling you a bit about the things I love and define me better than a list of old clients and “professional wins”. I’m not fit and I hate running (although I do do it sometimes) but I do love being outside, particularly in the ocean where you will usually find me body boarding or on my SUP (although I’ve been told that I have the balance of a new fawn). I also spend a lot of time at my local surf lifesaving club and I still row every week - something I started at school many, many years ago. Being out on the land also makes me happy, so does good coffee, my family and my dogs (aka. face and mouth). I’m obsessed with my garden and I'm always out doing something in it. It still doesn’t look good. I also enjoy making stuff - much of which involves electronics, lego and computers.

Ok, so computers bring me to the work stuff. I have been a software engineer for the best part of 25 years, mostly specialising in getting emerging technology into difficult to reach places. I now work across AgriFood and climate sectors in Australia, the US and UK where I develop strategy and implement industry defining technologies (even if I say so myself). I’m terrible at telling people about these things.

Twitter is my social platform of choice and you’ll mostly find me there [@andrewdotcom](http://www.twitter.com/andrewdotcom).
