My last post was about the changes I plan to make to the way I live and work this year. This one is to keep me honest about the software and programming languages that I want to crack in 2023. 

## Languages.

I'm pretty productive in Python but I wouldn't call myself a Python master. I want to change that this year and start to build a deep understanding of the language and Python best practice. 

[Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) is also a focus for me this year. I have been using JavaScript for years and again would count myself as fairly capable at using the language. I dipped my toe into Typescript in 2022 and the benefits are clear but for the couple of projects I used it on I felt I muddled my way through. This year I'll focus on getting a good grip of how to use typescript productively. 

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) has been on my list for ages and I haven't had the time to learn it. This year I plan to try and develop a couple of projects using rust and to get a working knowledge of the language. 

Finally, I really want to become productive with [Swift](https://www.swift.org). I have a long list of mobile apps I would like to develop but haven't really made the time to learn Swift. I've dabbled and reckon I know enough to be dangerous but I find that I quickly run out of steam and patience when I hit bugs or try to do more complicated stuff. Now that SwiftUI seems to be getting towards a place where it is usable I want to ship at least one mobile app this year and that means learning Swift. 

## Software 

The only software I want to master this year is [Fusion360](https://www.autodesk.com/products/fusion-360/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription). I have a 3D Printer and lots of ideas for things I want to make but am finding it infuriating that I can't translate what is in my head into a real object. To do this I need to get proficient with Fusion360 and I'm thinking this is going to be no small task.
