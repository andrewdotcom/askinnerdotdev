The [Raspberry Pi foundation has released a wifi enabled version of their Pico](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-w-your-6-iot-platform/) RP2040 powered microcontroller board, or as they call it their IoT platform. I have been an avid user of the original Pico since it's launch in 2021 and if I could only think of one feature to add it would have been wifi. I'm not going to go into all of the specs etc of the new Infineon CYW43439 wireless chip or some of the changes that have been made to the board to accomodate it but they are minor. 

The [CYW43439](https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/wireless-connectivity/airoc-wi-fi-plus-bluetooth-combos/cyw43439/) also supports Bluetooth and Bluetooth Low Energy which will open up many another possibilities however these are not yet available as the software for working with them is still being finalised. So is the certification for use of the board by those who control the wireless spectrums here in Australia meaning that booo I can't order a board yet (although I have preordered).

The Picow is not the first microcontroller to have wifi support but it is certianly one of the cheapest with the board costing US$6.

[People are already doing super interesting things with it](https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/raspberry-pi-pico-w-what-did-you-think/) from networking existing projects through to creating tiny web servers.

As you know, I work across agricultural industries here in Australia and I can see so many applications for a cheap, available board such as the Picow. So many sensor products curently in market cost $$$$ and I want to show producers that it doesn't need to cost a fortune to gather insights about their operations. Of course a Pico with wi-fi isn't going to change the dire state of regional conectivity but it does potentially help open up a new class of cheap IoT product that previously were hard to make available.
