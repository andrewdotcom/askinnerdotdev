It's January 2nd, 2023, and for the most part, things are exactly the same as they were before the new year (my car had a breakdown the day before, which was perfect timing with all the garages shut for the holidays). I'm sure those who know me are rolling their eyes at yet another new year's resolution post - I've had a history of starting and abandoning blogs, and I've also been terrible at keeping resolutions in the past. In fact, I haven't even bothered making any in the past few years. Despite all this, I still consider myself to be a decent person, even though I'm still overweight, disorganised and haven't made a million dollars yet.

But as I look back on the last couple of years, especially since I started working from home, I've noticed that my life has become a bit repetitive and my mental health has suffered. I've lost my enthusiasm for things and haven't been getting out of the house as much as I used to. Work is going well and some amazing people have trusted me to help them solve some truely interesting problems, but post-pandemic, I've found myself a bit flat.

So, this year, my resolutions are simple: get out more, be with people more, and do 50% less of some things and 50% more of others. These seem like achievable goals, rather than setting myself up for failure by saying I'll go to the gym 3 times a week (which I know I won't do). To get started, here are a few things I plan to focus on:

50% less. 
* Working at home on my own
* Buying coffee
* Wishing I had something I havenâ€™t
* Worrying about money
* Putting off tasks until the very last minute
* Being anxious 
* Food 
* Being grumpy and disparaging 

50% more
* Water
* JFDI
* Being with my children (my eldest is a teenager this year and I canâ€™t donâ€™t want to believe it)
* Volunteering
* Writing on my blog and social media
* Getting in touch with people 
* Trying new things
* Taking pride in my appearance (this includes my health)
* Being positive
* Making things with my hands
* Giving compliments widely and freely
* Budgeting and investing (I need to start thinking about my old age). 

Iâ€™m also going to have a go at sending postcards. I was reading about this one in the paper and I thought it sounded fun. My mum is great at doing this and itâ€™s always lovely to get get something in the mail. I donâ€™t really send mail anymore. Iâ€™m also terrible with things like birthday cards so this is an opportunity for improvement. 

So thatâ€™s it. Probably wildly ambitious but Iâ€™m going to check in on this post regularly throughout the year to see how Iâ€™m doing. At the very least it should give me something to write about ðŸ¤£.
