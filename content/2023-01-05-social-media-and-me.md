Iâ€™m not a sophisticated social media user. I have Facebook and Instagram accounts but by influencer terms, barely use either of them. For my sins, my social media channel of choice for the past 15+ years has been Twitter. Even then, I have only managed to amass about 700 followers. A good third of which I think are probably bots. I love Twitter though. Despite its current rocky state with all the blatant bots, self promotion, adverts, nut bags and outrage (itâ€™s also currently down in Australia). Twitter was where my friends hung out. Except increasingly now they donâ€™t. Since Mr Musk took over things at Twitter, a few have gone to places like Mastodon but mostly people seem to have just drifted away, this is also true for the Meta sites too. I am guilty of this, I only post AFL results to Facebook these days and in 2022 posted a grand total of 15 pictures to Instagram. As a result, In many ways it seems harder than ever to keep up with what people are doing both privately and professionally these days. 

So I have been thinking about what Iâ€™m going to do. This year I plan to put Facebook out to pasture, I will keep it around for the local community groups that I subscribe to as that is still a good (not great) source of info about what is happening in my local area [^1]. but I wonâ€™t be posting any content. Instagram will stay and so will Twitter. 

I am really hopeful for Twitter. It has a lot of issues but to date in my little filter bubble itâ€™s still mostly fun. I also think that despite whatâ€™s currently happening at Twitter HQ, if anyone can get it cranking over itâ€™s Elon Musk. It might just take a long time and cost him a good chunk more of his fortune. Iâ€™m certainly not one of those willing it to fail. 

So what am I going to be doing with social media this year? Well. Good question. Iâ€™m going to hunker down with Twitter and try and seize the potential opportunity of having fewer smart people on the platform (less competition) to increase my follower count. My OKR is > 1000 by the end of the year. I also want to take quite a few more Instagram photos and although it pains me to say it, I am going to invest some time in creating content for LinkedIn. 

Iâ€™ve never used LinkedIn for anything more than collecting the contact details of people with whom I have worked or done business with. This year I am going to try to use the platform to build a bit more  of a personal brand (I ðŸ¤® in my mouth a little just saying that). Iâ€™ve always thought I have some good things to say, but I have always had trouble with expressing them and/or having the confidence to express them. The outcome is that I discuss a lot of ideas with people who are good at expressing themselves who often run with the idea in their own posts (good on them). This year that changes. OKR 2 is to post at least one post to LinkedIn a month that is actually useful. 

Finally I need to also do all of this for my consulting business. More than Machines is now 18 months old and still has no website or social media presence. In 2023 this is not acceptable. Iâ€™ve been lucky enough to have tremendous growth in the first year and a half but to keep expanding the business needs a platform.

The next challenge is going to be coming up with the interesting content. Watch this spaceâ€¦
