Hi, my name is Andrew and this is my personal blog. I've been blogging for a long time but you would never know because I have a habit of restarting every couple of years. This is the latest iteration.

I am a Computer Scientist/Software Engineer working these days mostly in Agriculture. I'm fascinated by our food systems and the role of technology in feeding the next billion people.

I've been programming computers for years and professionally for over 20 years. Like many, I started with the ZX Spectrum and typing in code from magazines like Amstrad Action (I also had a Amstrad CPC6128). I learnt to program trying to be part of the Commodore Amiga demo scene. This led to a degree in Software Engineering and the rest is history. My languages of choice these days are C, Rust, Python and of course JavaScript (TypeScript) and SQL. I also design and build a lot of my own hardware, muck about with [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) and [Raspberry PI](http://www.raspberrypi.org) and have recently been getting pretty deep into 3D printing.

Professionally, I have had a career that has taken me around the world - to the USA, South Africa, Europe, the UAE and most recently to Australia where I now live by the beach on the New South Wales Central Coast with my family.

This blog is just my place on the web where I leave my thoughts and share my ideas with others. I write about technology, music, film and anything else that I find interesting. A lot of it probably won't be interesting to you but there may be the off nuggest that brings you here from your search engine of choice. Eitherway, thanks for dropping in and taking time to find out a bit about me.
