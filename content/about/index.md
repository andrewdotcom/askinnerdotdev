Hi, I'm Andrew, and this is my personal blog. I've been blogging for a long time, but I have a habit of restarting every couple of years. This is the latest iteration.

I'm a computer scientist and software engineer who mostly works in agriculture these days. I'm fascinated by our food systems and the role of technology in feeding the next billion people.

I've been programming computers for years, and professionally for over 20 years. I started with the ZX Spectrum, typing in code from magazines like Amstrad Action (I had an Amstrad CPC6128). I learned to program by trying to be part of the Commodore Amiga demo scene. This led to a degree in software engineering, and the rest is history. My languages of choice these days are C, Rust, Python, JavaScript (TypeScript), and SQL. I also design and build a lot of my own hardware, tinker with [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc) and [Raspberry PI](http://www.raspberrypi.org), and I've recently gotten pretty deep into 3D printing.

Professionally, my career has taken me around the world. I've been to the USA, South Africa, Europe, the UAE, and most recently, Australia, where I now live by the beach on the New South Wales Central Coast with my family.

This blog is my space on the web where I share my thoughts and ideas with others. I write about technology, music, film, and anything else that I find interesting. A lot of it probably won't be interesting to you, but there might be an occasional nugget that brings you here from your search engine of choice. Either way, thanks for dropping in and taking the time to learn a bit about me.
